# Customer Service - ASP.net Wep Application

The link of the website : http://amnaw1-001-site1.btempurl.com/

Web application built with ASP.net Framework using 'web form' model,
I used HTML, C# as the back-end Language, JavaScript for the client-side validation, CSS and Bootstrap to style the website.

I designed and built the database using SQL Server and I added CRUD (create-retrieve-update-delete) operations ,
and then applied ASP.net Membership to the database to facilitate adding the security features to the website.
I also used ASP membership classes.

Then I developed Login System and created Roles to the users which will allow them to have different privileges and will restrict certain content.

I developed six different web pages : AMNA 'home page', Customer Form, Finance, Admin, Login, Registration page.

## Dependencies

1. Connected Database(local or hosted) 'cutomerDB208'
2. MS Visual Studio to run the applicaton locally 
3. ASP.NET Membership
4. Bootstrap
